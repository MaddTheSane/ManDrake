# ManDrake

ManDrake is a native, open-source man page editor for Mac OS X. It has syntax highlighting and live-updating rendered preview.

Long story short, I was sick of writing man pages in an endless cycle of edit-view, edit-view so I decided to do something about it and made this editor. It's a bit rough around the edges, but it works really well for me.
